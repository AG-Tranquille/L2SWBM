TODOs (mostly for Joe, but feel free to add for others):

- Tentative: bias adjustment config options

- Version numbering system

- Edit model code to make options available that could be revealed in the config file (via Jacob)

(JPS) In regards to the coordination process - currently the L2SWBM outputs for use:

- 95% credible intervals for NBS components, component NBS, flows, diversions, and change in storage
- closure rates, if asked for in the config file
- simple plots to ensure things ran well

I don't know what all goes on in the coordination process, and therefor I wouldn't know what else to have as outputs from the model. 
Thus, given these initial outputs above, run through a few draft coordination processes, 
and identify what other outputs may be useful. These could be:

- cumulative water balance component time series
- X% credible intervals (other than 95%) to conform to certain practices
- an idea where input estimates are in the generated credible intervals (a posterior predictive P-Value)
- and more

Running through the process a few times with what's on hand now will inform me on how to re-code the model 
to better accommodate those needs.
