TODOs (mostly for Joe, but feel free to add for others):

- Tentative: bias adjustment config options

- Version numbering system

- Edit model code to make options available that could be revealed in the config file (via Jacob)

(JPS) In regards to the coordination process - currently the L2SWBM outputs for use:

- 95% credible intervals for NBS components, component NBS, flows, diversions, and change in storage
- closure rates, if asked for in the config file
- simple plots to ensure things ran well

I don't know what all goes on in the coordination process, and therefor I wouldn't know what else to have as outputs from the model. 
Thus, given these initial outputs above, run through a few draft coordination processes, 
and identify what other outputs may be useful. These could be:

- cumulative water balance component time series
- X% credible intervals (other than 95%) to conform to certain practices
- an idea where input estimates are in the generated credible intervals (a posterior predictive P-Value)
- and more

Running through the process a few times with what's on hand now will inform me on how to re-code the model 
to better accommodate those needs.

(LMF) How about developing alternative model that closes the water balance using RNBS instead of components? Not sure if this is too big of a task, but it could be interesting.
  NBS = Qout - Qin + dH + E
  Use RNBS as the prior for NBS.
  This could give us coordinated NBS with uncertainty, and I would think that havinv fewer variables would help to refine the uncertainty.
  Would this actually also help us with the full model if we ran it in a 2-step process: 1. close the model using NBS, 2. close the model using refined uncertainty in Qout, Qin, and dH based on step 1.
